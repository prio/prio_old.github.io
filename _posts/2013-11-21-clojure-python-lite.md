## Background

I have been tracking the progress of [clojure-py][1] on and off for
the past two years or so but unfortunately it has officially been
[dropped by its current maintainer][2]. I know node.js and
Clojurescript are Clojures "de-facto" scripting solution but I am more
familiar with the Python ecosystem so I was looking forward to being
able to use the libraries I know with Clojure. However, on the
clojure-py mailing list [Hy][3] was mentioned as a possible
alternative so I decided to take a look at Hy and see how close we can
get to a Clojure "like" environment on cPython. _Note:_ I am not
suggesting anyone use this setup for serious systems, its just a
fun exercise.

## Clojure features

This is not an exhaustive list of Clojure features but they are some
of the ones I use most often and I would like to have something
similar on the cPython platform.

* REPL
* Standard functional and Lisp functions/constructs
* Host interop
* Persistent data structures
* Protocols
* Concurrency constructs: Atoms, Futures, Threads, Refs, Agents
* Laziness
* Clojure niceties: threading macros, 
* Macros
* Meta data
* _Bonus_ Although not a language feature something like the awesome
  core.async library would be a clincher

OK, lets install hy and see how far we can get.


## REPL

Running `hy` on the command line gives us a REPL. It seems to do paren
matching and the up and down arrow keys work like you would
expect. Comments in hy start with a ; like Clojure, however writing a
comment in the REPL raises a parsing error. Being able to use this
from iPython would be very nice, not sure what it would entail
however. One for another day.

Verdict: 8/10

## Functional Lisp constructs

Hy seems to have a lot of the standard things you expect in a
Lisp. Lets try out some of the basic functions we expect.

{% highlight clojure %}
=> (first [1 2 3 4 5])
1
=> (rest [1 2 3 4 5])
[2, 3, 4, 5]
=> (car [1 2 3 4 5])
1
=> (cdr [1 2 3 4 5])
[2, 3, 4, 5]
=> (take 2 [ 1 2 3 4 ])
<generator object _hy_anon_fn_35 at 0x10d39ab40>
=> (list (take 2 [ 1 2 3 4 ]))
[1, 2]
=> (map inc [1 2 3 4 5])
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
=> (import operator)
=> (reduce operator.add [1 2 3 4 5])
15
=> (filter even? [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])
<generator object _hy_anon_fn_12 at 0x10d39ab40>
=> (list (filter even? [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]))
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
{% endhighlight %}

Ah, OK, take and filter are lazy and return a Python
generator. Everything works as expected so far. There is also a third
party Python library called [toolz][4] whose aim is to build on the
functions available in the Python functools and itertools modules. It
is heavily influenced by Clojure, "the toolz project generally adheres
closely to the API found in the Clojure standard library". Using it
from hy is easy:

{% highlight clojure %}
=> (import [toolz.itertoolz.core [concat cons count]])
=> (list (concat [[1 2] [3 4]]))
[1, 2, 3, 4]
=> (list (cons 1 [2 3]))
[1, 2, 3]
=> (count [1 2 3 4 5])
5
{% endhighlight %}

Using toolz in conjunction with Hy allows us to get most of the basics
we would expect. Lets move on to something more interesting.

Verdict: 8/10

## Host interop

Hy claims to be a "pythonic lisp" and its structure is converted to
Pythons AST for execution. As you would expect interop works very
well. Hy provides Clojure like '.' access to methods and an import
statement to import Python code. The kwapply function required to
supply keyword arguments is a bit ugly however (nitpicking).

Verdict: 9/10

## Persistent data structures

This is a big Clojure advantage, but since Hy is built on Python we
are stuck with Pythons mutable data structures by default. There seems
to be two third party libraries that provide basic persistent data
structures to Python, [pysistence][5] and [pyrsistent][6]. Pysistence
has an experimental C module so it may be more performant but it
doesn't seem to be actively maintained. Pysistence was recently
released and claims to have been inspired by Clojure. Performance is
"generally in the range of 2 - 100 times slower than using the
corresponding built in types in Python" but the author claims running
on PyPy can greatly improve performance. Since I plan to use
this setup for non-production scripts, performance isn't a deal breaker for me.

{% highlight clojure %}
=> (import [pyrsistent [pvec pmap pset]])
=> (def p1 (pvec 1 2 3))
=> (.append p1 4)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
=> p1
[1, 2, 3]
=> (def pm1 (kwapply (pmap) {:a 1 :b 2}))
=> pm1
{u'\ufdd0:a': 1, u'\ufdd0:b': 2}
=> (.todict pm1)
{u'\ufdd0:a': 1, u'\ufdd0:b': 2}
=> (:a pm1)
1
=> (.assoc pm1 :c 3)
{u'\ufdd0:a': 1, u'\ufdd0:c': 3, u'\ufdd0:b': 2}
{% endhighlight %}

Pyrsistent gives us persistent data structures but because its a third
party library we lose literal syntax (constructing a map is
unwieldy) and it is a very young project.

Verdict: 5/10

## Protocols

Protocols are a fundamental abstraction in Clojure and allow one to
write performant polymorphic functions. As part of this setup I am
just looking for something to provide me with a way to write
polymorphic functions of my own (performance not a concern). As luck
would have it [PEP 443][7] was recently approved and, a version of it
has been [back-ported to Python 2.7][8]. Singledispatch is a decorator
and does not let us group functions together like protocols.

{% highlight clojure %}
=> (import [singledispatch [singledispatch]])
=> (defclass bird [object])
=> (defclass aeroplane [object])
=> (with-decorator singledispatch (defn fly [arg] (print "I fly")))
=> (with-decorator (fly.register bird) (defn _ [self] (print "I fly by flapping")))
=> (with-decorator (fly.register aeroplane) (defn _ [self] (print "I fly using engines")))
=> (fly 1)
I fly
=> (fly (bird))
I fly by flapping
=> (fly (aeroplane))
I fly using engines
{% endhighlight %}

singledispath is not as powerful as protocols in the broader
sense. However it is part of the stdlib from 3.4 onwards and it lets
us write polymorphic functions in Hy which is what I was looking for.

Verdict: 8/10

## Next

Ok, this post is already longer than I was expecting and I am not
finished yet. I will finish the investigation in my next post.
